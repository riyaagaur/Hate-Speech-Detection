# Hate-Speech-Detection

Problem Description

Hate speech is any form of communication, whether verbal, written, or behavioral, that attacks or discriminates against individuals or groups based on attributes like religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, sex, or other identity factors. It has significant social and ethical implications, particularly in the digital space. This project focuses on developing an NLP-based system to detect hate speech in textual data, specifically Twitter tweets, to promote safer and more inclusive online environments.
